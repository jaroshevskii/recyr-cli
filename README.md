# 🌋 Recyr CLI

**Recyr CLI** is a lightweight, modern CLI tool for fixing broken Cyrillic text caused by incorrect encodings (e.g., Windows-1251 opened as UTF-8). Quickly convert your files back to proper UTF-8 and restore readable text.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically detect and fix Windows-1251 encoded files.
- Overwrite the original file or save to a new path.
- Simple CLI interface powered by Swift ArgumentParser.
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux).

## 💻 Installation

### Build from source

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/jaroshevskii/RecyrCLI.git
cd ReCyrillic
swift build -c release
```

### Make globally available (optional)

```zsh
sudo cp ./.build/release/RecyrCLI /usr/local/bin/recyr
```

Now you can run it from anywhere:

```zsh
recyr DemoBroken.txt
```

## ⚡ Usage

```zsh
# Fix a file and overwrite it
recyr path/to/file.txt

# Fix a file and save output to a new file
recyr path/to/file.txt --output fixed.txt
```

Example

```zsh
recyr DemoBroken.txt --output demo-fixed.txt
```

After running, demo-fixed.txt will contain correctly encoded UTF-8 text.

## 🧪 Demo file

You can test the tool with DemoBroken.txt provided in the repository. It contains intentionally broken Cyrillic text saved as Windows-1251.
